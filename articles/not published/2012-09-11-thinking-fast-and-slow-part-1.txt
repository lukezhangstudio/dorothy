Thinking fast and slow is a book that explores how our actions and choices are shaped by our mental physiology. That there exist a distinct seperation of the conscious thoughts and our subconscious behaviour - or system 1 and system 2 in the book's terminology.

The book describes experiments that demonstrate:

- system 2 choices are more rational but requires more effort.
- system 1 is automatic and takes care of many parts of our lives.
- our thoughts are within system 2 and it has no awareness of the subconscious proceses that influenced them. We feel an that our system 2 thoughts are the entirety of our being, but the truth is much different.

- experiments show that there exist something like a mental energy supply. That require difficult cognitive effort depletes this mental energy pool and lows our rational performance and stamina in subsequent tasks.

- There is a powerful concept of priming. Priming is everywhere in our lives, and it shows how subconscious changes in our enviroment shapes the results we get from our subconscious mind. Ie. seeing the words that describe old age influecnes our walking speed.

- Mental illusions exist that works by tricking the subconscious processes to produce an seemingly correct answer. If conscious effort is low, then the answer is taken as valid, but in fact it isn't.

- Attention requires effort. Sufficent amount of effort would make us effectively blind and deaf to other stimulus.

- our minds gravitate to things that require minimal cognitive effort. A smart solution is one that relies more on our automatic processes and less on our system 2 conscious effort. Given a set of options, the theory suggests that we will end up choosing the option that has the least effort required.

- By becoming aware of our automatic patterns, it does not mean that we suddenly change them. However, it means that our conscious mind will take over a keep points to make sure that we do not fall into an incorrect trap.

- familiarty means less mental cognitive effort. we have a strong preference for things that are familiar.
